The project focuses on creating a C program named "tarsau." This program is designed to carry out two primary tasks: 
tarsau -b : Merging files into a archive.
tarsau -a : Extracting files from an archive.
The archiving format involves combining multiple input files into a single output file, which contains information about the original files along with their content.
